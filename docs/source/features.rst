Features
========

Network Administrator to the Cloud Land is a cloud-based, scalable and
extensible network monitoring tool. Here is a list of the most important
features that NA provides:

* secure web API for collecting events from remote hosts
* grouping hosts into networks
* sharing hosts and networks with other users
* generating reports and sending them at a scheduled time
* useful dashboard with an up-to-date status of your network
* sending notifications through e-mail
* easy-to-use alerts system
* plugins API that lets extend lots of built-in features
* runs with both relational and non-relational databases
* tested on the Google AppEngine

Is that all?

The list above is just a beginning. We are still working on both new features
(mostly on advanced monitoring mechanisms) and new plugins. Go to the official
website of the Umit Project [#umitproject]_ for the latest updates.
