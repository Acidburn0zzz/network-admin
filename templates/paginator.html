The paginator template was designed to work with standard Django pagination
system. Therefore you should provide extra context which is:

	* is_paginated - set to True if you want turn pagination on
	* paginator - Paginator class object
	* page_obj - Page class object, representing current page
	
Moreover, to make this template work with every kind of pages, there is
one more parameter:

	* url - URL address to a listing page; this address shouldn't include
			the page number (e.g. /message/list/) which will be added here,
			based on page object

{% endcomment %}

{% load i18n %}
{% if is_paginated and paginator.num_pages > 1 %}
<form action="{{ url }}" method="GET">
<ul class="paginator">
	
	{% if page_obj.has_previous %}
	<li><a href="{{ url }}page/{{ page_obj.previous_page_number }}/">{% trans "Previous page" %}</a></li>
	{% endif %}
	
	{% if page_obj.has_next %}
	<li><a href="{{ url }}page/{{ page_obj.next_page_number }}/">{% trans "Next page" %}</a></li>
	{% endif %}
	
	<li>{% trans "Go to page" %}:
		<select name="page">
		{% for page_num in paginator.page_range %}
			<option>{{ page_num }}</option>
		{% endfor %}
		</select>
		<input type="submit" value="{% trans "Go" %}" />
	</li>
	
</ul>
</form>
{% endif %}
